As a Python and Web Automation Expert, I attempted to monitor "Make an Order" event triggers on the Katana Platform using Make.com.
However, I encountered a limitation due to the absence of a dedicated "Watch Make an Order" module for Katana.
Consequently, I decided to develop a solution using Python and the Katana API.


Katana Platform provides various event triggers and webhooks that can be utilized for automation purposes. You can typically find triggers for events such as:

Order Creation: Triggers when a new order is created.
Order Updates: Triggers when an existing order is modified.
Inventory Changes: Triggers when inventory levels change.
Customer Changes: Triggers when customer information is updated.
To implement automation, you can set up webhooks that notify your application of these events in real-time. Check the Katana API documentation for detailed information on available webhooks and how to configure them for your specific use case.
