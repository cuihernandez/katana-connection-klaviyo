As a Python and Web Automation Expert, I attempted to monitor "Make an Order" event triggers on the Katana Platform using Make.com.
However, I encountered a limitation due to the absence of a dedicated "Watch Make an Order" module for Katana.
Consequently, I decided to develop a solution using Python and the Katana API.
